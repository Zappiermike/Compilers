This is the README for Michael Scheie's Compilers Lab Submission

Comments have been added accordingly to the following files:
	AssignmentStmt.java
	Compiler.java
	DeclarationStmt.java
	library.c
	LibraryDeclarations.java
	LoadExpr.java
	Parser.cup
	Procedure.java
	scanner.jflex
	SequenceProcedure.java

The last phase asked us to handle putchar and println using our own compiler by
passing them as arguments in our testProgram.c file. This is commented in library.c
and LibraryDeclarations.java
