This is the README for Michael Scheie's Compilers Lab Submission for San Skulrattanakulchai's Compilers MCS-388

Comments have been added accordingly to the following files:
	CallExpr.java
	Compilers.java
	HashTable.java
	LoadExpr.java
	parser.cup
	Procedure.java
	ProcedureDecl.java
	SequenceProcedure.java
	testProgram.c

	Note: LibraryDeclarations.java was no longer needed so it was deleted. 
		  library.c was also no longer needed, but the clang build will fail
		  if it doesn't find a library.c file. Thus, a library.c file does exist
		  but it contains a single comment
