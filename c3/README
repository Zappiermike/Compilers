Comments have been added accordingly to the following files:
	testProgram.c
	EmptyStmt.java
	Parser.cup
	Scanner.jflex

Parser.cup, Scanner.jflex, and testProgram.c have their comments contained within the code.

EmptyStmt.java has the comments contained the code as well, but can also be seen in .html format.

will no longer work due to those changes.
