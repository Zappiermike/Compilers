This is the README for Michael Scheie's Compilers Lab Submission

Comments have been added accordingly to the following files:
	ComparisonExpr.java
	Compiler.java
	EqEqExpr.java
	HashTable.java
	IfElseStmt.java
	IfStmt.java
	LessEqExpr.java
	LessExpr.java
	MoreEqExpr.java
	MoreExpr.java
	NotEqExpr.java
	Procedure.java
	SymbolTable.java
	WhileStmt.java
	Parser.cup
	scanner.jflex
	testProgram.c

The last phase asked us to allocate variables accordingly if they were within loops etc. We extracted 
all the allocation lines and moved them to the top. Procedure.java includes more comments about it.
We can see that it is working by checking testProgram.ll where all the "alloca" commands are at the top.
